#' Step selection functions
#' ========================================================
#' 
#' For each step (i.e. pair of successive locations),
#' the environmental conditions at the chosen location are compared to those at other available locations.
#' 
#' For one environmental predictor x (e.g. NDVI), 
#' the probability $p_i$ of observing the chosen location $i$ at a distance $d_i$ from the current location is given by:
#' $$ p_i = \frac{exp(\alpha d_i + \beta x_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} exp(\alpha d_j + \beta x_j)} $$
#'  
#' where 
#' - $\alpha$ is the regression coefficient quantifying the effect of distance, 
#' - $\beta$ is the regression coefficient quantifying the environmental selection, 
#' - $N$ is the total number of alternative locations considered for the step.
#' 
#' The exponential function ensures that the individual weights for each alternative location are positive, 
#' and the sum in the denominator ensures that the individual weights sum to one.
#' 
#' The values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are chosen such that the probability (likelihood) of the observed loations is maximized.

#'Setting up the working directory
#'=================================
#' Add in your working directory that contains the function file below 

#' and sourcing some functions (a poor man's package):
source("ssf_fun_2016_final.R")

#'Load buffalo data
#'==========================================
#'See Kami's slides for how we got here...
load("buffalo_cleaned.Rdata")

#'Always inspect your data: summary statistics
#'============================================
summary(buffalo)

#'Always inspect your data: plots
#'===============================
plot(buffalo)

#'Environmental data: topography, waterways, and NDVI
#'========================================
#'

env <- brick("env_buffalo.grd")   # creating a multi layer raster object from a multi layer band
plot(env)


#' Thin movement data and split to bursts
#' ===================================
step_duration <- 180   # three hours (180 minutes)
#' - We reduce the data set to observations that are within a certain time step range. The SSF assumes Brownian motion,
#' so we should thin sufficiently. See presentation by Chris tomorrow. Here: we go for roughly `r step_duration/60` hours. 
#' - When two observations are separated by less than the threshold, the second observation is removed
#' - When two observations are separated by more than the upper threshold, the observations are assigned to different bursts
#' if you can get away with an exponential step length distribution, USE THAT
#'

#' Thin movement data and split to bursts
#' ===================================


thinned_buf <- moveStack(lapply(split(buffalo), 
  thin_split, step_duration, unit = "mins"))

tbuf_df <- as(thinned_buf, "data.frame")
tbuf_df

#' - First, we *split(buffalo_data)*, i.e. we create a list of move objects, with one list element for each animal
#' - Second, we use *lapply* to loop through the list, and apply the function *thin_split_new* to each animal, 
#'   with the two additional arguments target_interval = `r step_duration`, and units = "mins"
#' - splits the data where the time gap is too long; in this case, if the gap is longer than the 3 hour period 
#' - Third, we re-create a moveStack from the thinned data of each animal 
#'
 
#' Remove observations without movement (optional)
#' ====================================
#' We remove observations where the animal did not move - this is only necessary if we want
#' to use step length distributions such as lognormal that do not allow for zero displacement.
#' Here, we have only one observation that has a distance of zero, so removing it is not likely to
#' bias the results
#' - be cautious doing this; should be done rarely; only if animal moves a LOT between steps
#' 
which(unlist(distance(thinned_buf)) == 0)
if (any(unlist(distance(thinned_buf)) == 0)) {
  thinned_buf <- thinned_buf[-which(unlist(distance(thinned_buf)) == 0),  ]
  thinned_buf <- moveStack(lapply(split(thinned_buf), 
                                   thin_split, step_duration, unit = "mins"))
}

#' Create control locations for each case
#' ==========================
#' - Prepare an object "angle_dist", which contains for each step in the thinned data
#'     * the relative angle (in radians) of the step and 
#'     * the distance of the step
#' - This information is used to estimate parameters for the distribution of proposed steps
#'
 
#' Create control locations for each case cont.

# if you were to do model selection here to find out which is best fit, 
# you would need to include the environmental data
# because they should be influencing the step selection
# Exponential is best, as it's the simplest and looks to fit the best


#' Fit distribution to turning angles
#' =============================
#' 
fkappa <- est.kappa(angle_dist_buf[,"rel.angle"])
fkappa
hist(angle_dist_buf[, "rel.angle"], prob = TRUE, main = "", xlab = "Turning angle")
plot(function(x) dvonmises(x, circular(0), kappa=fkappa), add = TRUE, 
     from = -pi, to = pi, col = "red")

# von mises distribution is a normal distribution about 0

#' Create control locations for each case
#' ==========================
#' Currently, the code for generating alternative steps; much easier to calculate this stuff with flat projections
#' assumes a suitable "flat" projection, so we pick the appropriate UTM projection for the study area

utm_crs_buf <- CRS("+proj=utm +zone=36 +south +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0")

#' Create control locations for each case cont.
#' ==========================
#' Control steps: sample with one of the following distance distributions: exponential, gamma, lognormal, halfnormal,
#' potentially drawing turning angles from a von Mises distribution.
#' We will use an exponential distribution here because it is the simplest and it seems to fit the data well.
#' We will use a radially symmetric proposal distribution because it is easier to interpret parameter estimates for cos(rel.angle), and
#' because in an earlier analysis on these data it showed less residual autocorrelation.
#' 

my_K <- 100  # tells it how many alternative locations to sample

set.seed(3)    # setting the seed here ensure that the next time you do the analysis, you'll get the same results
ssf_data_buf <- prepare_ssf_steps(thinned_buf,    # create alternative steps from the "thinned_data" object
                                  method = "exponential", K = my_K,       # again, exponential is best
                                  theta = fexp$estimate / 2,              # theta is rate parameter; inverse of mean distance
                                  crs = utm_crs_buf)

#' - We set the random number generator seed to get reproducible results
#' - K = `r my_K` control points is a rather low number. More should give less variable results, 
#'   but at the cost of additional computing effort
#' - We use a wider proposal distribution than the observed steps (Forester et al. 2009)
#' 

#' Sanity check: plot the choice set for a given step
#' make sure alternative positions are really around the real positions

envmat <- extract(env, spTransform(ssf_data_buf, env@crs))

#' ==================================

#' Add variable hour
#' =================
#' Allows to model variation in step lengths, turning angles,
#' and preference for environmental conditions as a function of time of day
#' if we want to make selection of NDVI dependent on time of day

  xlab = "Time of day", ylab = "cos(turning angle)")
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))

## shows crepuscular movement

#' Selecting Cilla (only one animal) to speed up things
#' =================================
ssf_cilla <- subset(ssf_data_buf, id == "Cilla")

# Remove NA's
ssf_cilla <- ssf_cilla[complete.cases(ssf_cilla@data),]

#' Collinearity
#' ============= 
#' 
round(cor(ssf_cilla@data[, c("slope", "elev", 
  "water_dist", "mean_NDVI", "var_NDVI")]), 2)

#'elev and water_dist are positively correlated > 0.7
#' check how our explanatory variables (covariates) are correlated with each other
#' positive correlation between elevation and distance to water --- this makes sense!
#' if you have strong correlation between two variables, makes it difficult to detect effect of each of these variables on the dependant variable
#' so, should just pick one of these variables

#' Which collinear variable to pick? 
#' ===================
#' - The one that is more relevant
#' - The one that is by itself a better predictor
#' 

#' Collinearity
#' ============= 
m1_exp_water <- clogit(used ~ cos(rel.angle) + dist + water_dist +   # use cosine of rel. angle because it makes straight ahead = 1, as cos 0 = 1
   strata(stratum), data = ssf_cilla)
m1_exp_elev <- clogit(used ~ cos(rel.angle) + dist + elev + 
  strata(stratum), data = ssf_cilla)
AIC(m1_exp_water)
AIC(m1_exp_elev)

# clogit regression used because a GROUP of alternative positions has a 
# sum of probility equal to one, rather than individual alternative locations

#' So we pick elev, because it by itself explains the movement better
#' 

#' Calculate step selection function
#' ==========================
#'
m_1 <- clogit(used ~ cos(rel.angle) + dist + slope + elev + mean_NDVI +
  var_NDVI + strata(stratum), 
  data = ssf_cilla)
summary(m_1)

#' slope and var_NDVI do not contribute significantly to the fit
#' the negative distance implies that animals are picking shorter step lengths than what we proposed (which were long ones)
#' seem to select areas with higher NDVI
#' if NDVI_var was significant and negative, it would mean the animal would avoid areas with highly variable NDVI    

#' Model selection
#' ==================
#' Model selection is a vast topic. Here just use stepwise backward selection
#' based on AIC
m_2 <- update(m_1, .~. - slope)
AIC(m_1)
AIC(m_2)
summary(m_2)

#' Model selection
#' ==================
m_3 <- update(m_2, .~. - var_NDVI)
AIC(m_3)
summary(m_3)


#' Model selection
#' ==================
m_4 <- update(m_3, .~. - dist)
AIC(m_4)
# So we stick with m_3


#' Model checking: serial autocorrelation
#' ======================
#' Forester et al. 2009 Ecology 90:3554-3565.
#' 
#' Calculate the deviance residuals for each stratum (i.e., the sum of the residuals 
#' for the case and all associated controls).
ssf_cilla$m_3_residuals <- residuals(m_3, type = 
  "deviance")
resid_df <- group_by(ssf_cilla@data, date)
resid_df <- summarise(resid_df, residuals = 
  sum(m_3_residuals))
resid_df$group <- 1
#' Fit an intercept-only mixed-effects model using lme() from the nlme package.
library(nlme)
rm1 <- lme(residuals ~ 1, random = ~ 1 | group, 
           data = resid_df)

summary(rm1)

#' Model checking: serial autocorrelation cont.
#' ======================
plot(ACF(rm1), alpha = 0.05)


#' So there is some residual temporal autocorrelation; especially at time lag 1; we violate basic assumptions here
#' to get rid of this, must increase step length
#' One effect of residual temporal autocorrelation is too extreme p-values, but it may also cause bias in parameter estimates.
#' 


#' Model evaluation
#' ================
#' - R2 is low. Always is. Why?  If it was 1, we would have to predict exactly where the animal moves
#' - Not yet clear what a good performance index would be.
#' - Consider this an exercise. 
#' Here: we contrast for used and alternative steps the 
#' "Proportion of values less than or equal to the current value"
#' 
#' - Cross-validation
#'     - split steps in e.g. 5 folds (long stretches better)
#'     - leave each fold out, refit and predict to left-out fold
#'

#' Model evaluation
#' ================
#' "Proportion of values less than or equal to the current value"
#' AUC - area under the receiver operating characteristic curve



ssf_cilla$pred_m3 <- predict(m_3)
by_stratum <- group_by(ssf_cilla@data, stratum)
by_stratum <- mutate(by_stratum, pred_rank = 
                       cume_dist(pred_m3))

#' Model evaluation
#' ================

hist(subset(by_stratum, used == 1)$pred_rank, xlab = "AUC", main = "", prob = TRUE)
#' this shows that most of the time, the animal actually goes to a better site; i.e., few crappy steps
#' Mean AUC across steps
mean(subset(by_stratum, used == 1)$pred_rank)   # our mean AUC is 0.75
# to really evaluate this, we should split our data into training and test sets

#' Interpretation
#' ===============
#' - Map preference
#' - Variable importance (see SDM this afternoon)
#' - Response functions (only interesting for time varying parameters)
#' 

#' Map habitat preference
#' ======================
#' The raster prediction function assumes that all environmental layers are
#' respresented in one raster stack

# required for prediction by clogit model, but does 
# not affect result

pred_df_map <- data.frame(getValues(env))

#' Map habitat preference
#' ======================

m3_pred_raster <- raster(env, 1) # Create raster layer
m3_pred_raster[] <- m3_pred
plot(m3_pred_raster)      # green areas should be attractive areas; white should be avoided

#' Overlay cilla
#' =============

          "Cilla")
plot(m3_pred_raster)

#' Same, but zoom in

#'

#' 
#' - Simulate data with a known model

#' - Compare fitted parameters to those of the known model
#'

#' From preference to utilisation maps
#' ==================================
#' There is a fast method if we have a symmetric jump kernel, e.g. exponential, and no effect of step angles.
